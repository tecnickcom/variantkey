## Description

Human genetic variants are usually represented by four values with variable length: chromosome, position, reference and alternate alleles. There is no guarantee that these components are represented in a consistent way across different data sources, and processing variant-based data can be inefficient because four different comparison operations are needed for each variant, three of which are string comparisons. Working with strings, in contrast to numbers, poses extra challenges on computer memory allocation and data-representation. Existing variant identifiers do not typically  represent every possible variant we may be interested in, nor they are directly reversible.

**VariantKey**, a novel reversible numerical encoding schema for human genetic variants, overcomes these limitations by allowing to process variants as a single 64 bit numeric entities while preserving the ability to be searched and sorted per chromosome and position.

The individual components of short variants (up to 11 bases between `REF` and `ALT` alleles) can be directly read back from the VariantKey, while long variants requires a lookup table to retrieve the reference and alternate allele strings.

The [VariantKey Format](#vkformat) doesn't represent universal codes, it only encodes `CHROM`, `POS`, `REF` and `ALT`, so each code is unique for a given reference genome. The direct comparisons of two VariantKeys makes sense only if they both refer to the same genome reference.

This software library can be used to generate and reverse [VariantKey](#vkformat)s and [RegionKey](#regionkey)s.

## Quick Start

This project includes a Makefile that allows you to test and build the project in a Linux-compatible system with simple commands.

To see all available options, from the project root type:

```
make help
```

To build all the VariantKey versions inside a Docker container (requires Docker):

```
make dbuild
```

An arbitrary make target can be executed inside a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container by specifying the `MAKETARGET` parameter:

```
MAKETARGET='build' make dbuild
```
The list of make targets can be obtained by typing ```make```


The base Docker building environment is defined in the following Dockerfile:

```
resources/Docker/Dockerfile.dev
```

To build and test only a specific language version, `cd` into the language directory and use the `make` command.
For example:

```
cd c
make test
```

## Human Genetic Variant Definition

In this context, the human genetic variant for a given genome assembly is defined as the set of four components compatible with the VCF format:

* **`CHROM`** - chromosome: An identifier from the reference genome. It only has 26 valid values: autosomes from 1 to 22, the sex chromosomes X=23 and Y=24, mitochondria MT=25 and a symbol NA=0 to indicate missing data.
* **`POS`** - position: The reference position in the chromosome, with the first nucleotide having position 0. The largest expected value is less than 250 million to represent the last base pair in the chromosome 1.
* **`REF`** - reference allele: String containing a sequence of reference nucleotide letters. The value in the POS field refers to the position of the first nucleotide in the String.
* **`ALT`** - alternate allele: Single alternate non-reference allele. String containing a sequence of nucleotide letters. Multiallelic variants must be decomposed in individual biallelic variants.


<a name="decompandnorm"></a>
## Variant Decomposition and Normalization

The *VariantKey* model assumes that the variants have been decomposed and normalized.

<a name="decomposition"></a>
### Decomposition

In the common *Variant Call Format* (VCF) the alternate field can contain comma-separated strings for multiallelic variants, while in this context we only consider biallelic variants to allow for allelic comparisons between different data sets.

For example, the multiallelic variant:

```
    {CHROM=1, POS=3759889, REF=TA, ALT=TAA,TAAA,T}
```

can be decomposed as three biallelic variants:

```
    {CHROM=1, POS=3759889, REF=TA, ALT=TAA}
    {CHROM=1, POS=3759889, REF=TA, ALT=TAAA}
    {CHROM=1, POS=3759889, REF=TA, ALT=T}
```

In VCF files the decomposition from multiallelic to biallelic variants can be performed using the '[vt](https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Vt#Decompose)' software tool with the command:

```
    vt decompose -s source.vcf -o decomposed.vcf
```

The `-s` option (smart decomposition) splits up `INFO` and `GENOTYPE` fields that have number counts of `R` and `A` appropriately.


#### Example:

* input

```

<a name="normalization"></a>
### Normalization

A normalization step is required to ensure a consistent and unambiguous representation of variants.
As shown in the following example, there are multiple ways to represent the same variant, but only one can be considered "normalized" as defined by [Tan et al., 2015](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv112):

* *A variant representation is normalized if and only if it is left aligned and parsimonious.*
* *A variant representation is left aligned if and only if its base position is smallest among all potential representations having the same allele length and representing the same variant.*
* *A variant representation is parsimonious if and only if the entry has the shortest allele length among all VCF entries representing the same variant.*

Example of entries representing the same variant:

```
                                                  DELETE
                                    POS: 0        ||
                         VARIANT    REF: GGGCACACACAGGG
                                    ALT: GGGCACACAGGG

                                    POS:      5
                  NOT-LEFT-ALIGNED  REF:      CAC
                                    ALT:      C

                                    POS:   2
NOT-LEFT-ALIGNED, NOT-PARSIMONIOUS  REF:   GCACA
                                    ALT:   GCA

                                    POS:  1
                  NOT-PARSIMONIOUS  REF:  GGCA
                                    ALT:  GG

                                    POS:   2
                      NORMALIZED    REF:   GCA
                                    ALT:   G
```

In VCF files the variant normalization can be performed using the [vt](https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Vt#Normalization) software tool with the command:

```
    vt normalize decomposed.vcf -m -r genome.fa -o normalized.vcf
```
or the [bcftools](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html#norm) software with the command:

```
    bcftools norm -f genome.fa -o normalized.vcf decomposed.vcf
```

or decompose and normalize with a single command:

```
    bcftools norm --multiallelics -any -f genome.fa -o normalized.vcf source.vcf
```

<a name="normfunc"></a>
#### Normalization Function

Individual biallelic variants can be normalized using the `normalize_variant` function provided by this library.  

The `normalize_variant` function first checks if the reference allele matches the genome reference.
The match is considered valid and consistent if there is a perfect letter-by-letter match, and valid but not consistent if one or more letter matches an equivalent one. The equivalent letters are defined as follows [[Cornish-Bowden, 1984](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC341218/)]:

```
    SYMBOL | DESCRIPTION                   | BASES   | COMPLEMENT
    -------+-------------------------------+---------+-----------
       A   | Adenine                       | A       |  T
       C   | Cytosine                      |   C     |  G
       G   | Guanine                       |     G   |  C
       T   | Thymine                       |       T |  A
       W   | Weak                          | A     T |  W
       S   | Strong                        |   C G   |  S
       M   | aMino                         | A C     |  K
       K   | Keto                          |     G T |  M
       R   | puRine                        | A   G   |  Y
       Y   | pYrimidine                    |   C   T |  R
       B   | not A (B comes after A)       |   C G T |  V
       D   | not C (D comes after C)       | A   G T |  H
       H   | not G (H comes after G)       | A C   T |  D
       V   | not T (V comes after T and U) | A C G   |  B
       N   | aNy base (not a gap)          | A C G T |  N
    -------+-------------------------------+---------+----------
```

If the reference allele is not valid, the `normalize_variant` function tries to find a reference match with one of the following variant transformations:

* **swap** the reference and alternate alleles - *sometimes it is not clear which one is the reference and which one is the alternate allele*.
* **flip** the alleles letters (use the **complement** letters) - *sometimes the alleles refers to the other DNA strand*.
* **swap** and **flip**.

Note that the *swap* and *flip* processes can lead to false positive cases, especially when considering *Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms* (SNPs). The return code of the `normalize_variant` function can be used to discriminate or discard variants that are not consistent.

If the variant doesn't match the genome reference, then the original variant is returned with an error code.

If both alleles have length 1, the normalization is complete and the variant is returned.
Otherwise, a custom implementation of the [vt normalization](https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/Vt#Normalization) algorithm is applied:

```
while break, do
    if any of the alelles is empty and the position is greater than zero, then
        extend both alleles one letter to the left using the nucleotide in
        the corresponding genome reference position;
    else
        if both alleles end with the same letter and they have length 2 or more, then
            truncate the rightmost letter of each allele;
        else
            break (exit the while loop);

while both alleles start with the same letter and have length 2 or more, do
    truncate leftmost letter of each allele;
```

The genome reference binary file can be obtained from a FASTA file using the `resources/tools/fastabin.sh` script.
This script extracts the first 25 sequences for chromosomes `1` to `22`, `X`, `Y` and `MT`.

#### Normalized VariantKey

This library provides the `normalized_variantkey` function that returns the VariantKey of the normalized variant.
This function should be used instead of `variantkey` if the input variant is not normalized.


<a name="vkformat"></a>
## VariantKey Format

For a given reference genome the VariantKey format encodes a *Human Genetic Variant* (`CHROM`, `POS`, `REF` and `ALT`) as 64 bit unsigned integer number (8 bytes or 16 hexadecimal symbols).
If the variant has not more than 11 bases between `REF` and `ALT`, the correspondent VariantKey can be directly reversed to get back the individual `CHROM`, `POS`, `REF` and `ALT` components.
If the variant has more than 11 bases, or non-base nucleotide letters are contained in `REF` or `ALT`, the VariantKey can be fully reversed with the support of a binary lookup table.


The VariantKey is composed of 3 sections arranged in 64 bit:


```
         0   4 5                             32 33                              63
         |   | |                              | |                                |
         01234 567 89012345 67890123 45678901 2 3456789 01234567 89012345 67890123
5 bit CHROM >| |<         28 bit POS         >| |<        31 bit REF+ALT        >|
```

Example of VariantKey encoding:

```
                   | CHROM | POS                          | REF | ALT                           |

         Example: 'chr19' str = 19 dec = 10011 bin
    ```

    The chromosome is encoded as unsigned integer number: 1 to 22, X=23, Y=24, MT=25, NA=0.  
    This section is 5 bit long, so it can store up to 2<sup>5</sup>=32 symbols, enough to contain the required 25 canonical chromosome symbols + NA.  
    The largest value is: 25 dec = 19 hex = 11001 bin.  
    Values from 26 to 31 are currently reserved. They can be used to indicate 6 alternative modes to interpret the remaining 59 bit. For instance, one of these values can be used to indicate the encoding of variants that occurs in non-canonical contigs.  


* **`POS`** : 28 bit for the reference position (`POS`), with the first nucleotide having position 0.

    ```

         Example: 29238771 dec = 0001101111100010010111110011 bin
    ```

    This section is 28 bit long, so it can store up to 2<sup>28</sup>=268,435,456 symbols, enough to contain the maximum position found on the largest human chromosome.


* **`REF+ALT`** : 31 bit for the encoding of the `REF` and `ALT` strings.

    ```
         0                                    33                               63

         REF+ALT binary mask (7FFFFFFF hex = 2147483647 dec)
    ```

    This section allow two different type of encodings:

    * **Non-reversible encoding**

        If the total number of nucleotides between `REF` and `ALT` is more then 11, or if any of the alleles contains nucleotide letters other than base `A`, `C`, `G` and `T`, then the LSB (least significant bit) is set to 1 and the remaining 30 bit are filled with an hash value of the `REF` and `ALT` strings.  
        The hash value is calulated using a custom fast non-cryptographic algorithm based on [MurmurHash3](https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher/wiki/MurmurHash3).  
        A lookup table is required to reverse the `REF` and `ALT` values.  
        In the normalized dbSNP VCF file GRCh37.p13.b150 there are only 0.365% (1229769 / 337162128) variants that requires this encoding. Amongst those, the maximum number of variants that share the same chromosome and position is 15. With 30 bit the probability of hash collision is approximately 10<sup>-7</sup> for 15 elements, 10<sup>-6</sup> for 46 and 10<sup>-5</sup> for 146.
        The size of the non-reversible lookup table for GRCh37.p13.b150 is only 45.7MB.

    * **Reversible encoding**

        If the total number of nucleotides between `REF` and `ALT` is 11 or less, and they only contain base letters `A`, `C`, `G` and `T`, then the LSB is set to 0 and the remaining 30 bit are used as follows:  
        * bit 1-4 indicates the number of bases in `REF` - the capacity of this section is 2<sup>4</sup>=16; the maximum expected value is 10 dec = 1010 bin;
        * bit 5-8 indicates the number of bases in `ALT` - the capacity of this section is 2<sup>4</sup>=16; the maximum expected value is 10 dec = 1010 bin;
        * the following 11 groups of 2 bit are used to represent `REF` bases followed by `ALT`, with the following encoding:
            * `A` = 0 dec = 00 bin;
            * `C` = 1 dec = 01 bin;
            * `G` = 2 dec = 10 bin;
            * `T` = 3 dec = 11 bin.

        Examples:

        ```

### VariantKey Properties

* It can be encoded and decoded on-the-fly.
* Sorting by VariantKey is equivalent of sorting by `CHROM` and `POS`.
* The 64 bit VariantKey can be exported as a 16 character hexadecimal string.
* Sorting the hexadecimal representation of VariantKey in alphabetical order is equivalent of sorting the VariantKey numerically.
* Each VariantKey code is unique for a given reference genome.
* The direct comparisons of two VariantKeys makes sense only if they both refer to the same genome reference.
* Comparing two variants by VariantKey only requires comparing two 64 bit numbers, a very well optimized operation in current computer architectures. In contrast, comparing two normalized variants in VCF format requires comparing one numbers and three strings.
* VariantKey can be used as a main database key to index data by "variant". This simplify common searching, merging and filtering operations.
* All types of database joins between two data sets (inner, left, right and full) can be easily performed using the VariantKey as index.
* When `CHROM`, `REF` and `ALT` are the only strings in a table, replacing them with VariantKey allows to work with numeric only tables with obvious advantages. This also allows to represent the data in a compact binary format where each column uses a fixed number of bit, with the ability to perform a quick binary search on the first sorted column.


<a name="vkinput"></a>
## VariantKey Input values

* **`CHROM`** - *chromosome*     : Identifier from the reference genome, no white-space permitted.
* **`POS`**   - *position*       : The reference position, with the first nucleotide having position 0.
* **`REF`**   - *reference allele* :
    String containing a sequence of [nucleotide letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_notation).
    The value in the `POS` field refers to the position of the first nucleotide in the string.
* **`ALT`**   - *alternate non-reference allele* : 
    String containing a sequence of [nucleotide letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_notation).

## RegionKey

*RegionKey* encodes a human genomic region (defined as the set of *chromosome*, *start position*, *end position* and *strand direction*) in a 64 bit unsigned integer number.

RegionKey allows to repesent a region as a single entity, and provides analogous properties as the ones listed in [VariantKey Properties](#vkproperties).

The encoding of the first 33 bit (CROM, STARTPOS) is the same as in VariantKey.

The RegionKey is composed of 4 sections arranged in 64 bit:


```
         0   4 5                             32 33                           60    63

```


Example of RegionKey encoding:

```
                  | CHROM | STARTPOS                     | ENDPOS                       | STRAND |

------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

* **`CHROM`**   : 5 bit to represent the chromosome.  
  An identifier from the reference genome. It only has 26 valid values: autosomes from 1 to 22, the sex chromosomes X=23 and Y=24, mitochondria MT=25 and a symbol NA=0 to indicate an invalid value.

    ```

        Example: 'chr19' str = 19 dec = 10011 bin
    ```

    The chromosome is encoded as in VariantKey.

* **`STARTPOS`** : 28 bit for the region START position.  
  The region start position in the chromosome, with the first base having position 0. The largest expected value is less than 250 million to represent the last base pair in Chromosome 1.

    ```
        0    5                              32                                63

    ```

    This section is encoded as in VariantKey POS.

* **`ENDPOS`** : 28 bit for the region END position.  
  The region end position in the chromosome. The end position is equivalent to (STARTPOS + REGION_LENGTH), such that the base having position ENDPOS is not included in the region.

```
        0                                    33                            60 63

        Example: 29239026 dec = 0001101111100010011011110010 bin
```
    The end position is equivalent to (STARTPOS + REGION_LENGTH).

* **`STRAND`** : 2 bit to encode the strand direction.  
  (optional) The direction of the DNA strand. This is useful when encoding genic regions.

    ```
        0                                                                 61  62
        |                                                                   ||

                                                                            ||
                                                                         MSB  LSB
    ```

    The strand direction is encoded as:

    ```
    -1 : 2 dec = "10" bin = reverse (minus) strand direction
     0 : 0 dec = "00" bin = unknown or not applicable strand direction
    +1 : 1 dec = "01" bin = forward (plus) strand direction
    ```

* The last bit of RegionKey is reserved.

This software library provides several functions to operate with *RegionKey* and interact with *VariantKey*.

### RegionKey Properties

* It is compatible with VariantKey.
* It can be encoded and decoded on-the-fly.
* Sorting by RegionKey is equivalent of sorting by CHROM and STARTPOS.
* The 64 bit RegionKey can be exported as a single 16 character hexadecimal string.
* Sorting the hexadecimal representation of RegionKey in alphabetical order is equivalent of sorting the RegionKey numerically.
* RegionKey can be used as a main database key to index data by "region". This simplify common searching, merging and filtering operations.

## Encoding String IDs

This library contains extra functions to encode some string IDs to 64 bit unsigned integers:

* The `encode_string_id` function encodes maximum 10 ASCII characters (from '!' to 'z') of a string into a 64 bit unsigned integer. The encoded value can be reversed into a "normalized" version of the original 10 character string using the `decode_string_id` function. The decoded string only support uppercase characters.

* The `encode_string_num_id` function encodes string composed by a character section followed by a separator character and a numerical section into a 64 bit unsigned integer. For example: "`ABCDE:0001234`". This function encodes up to 5 characters in uppercase, a number up to 2<sup>27</sup>, and up to 7 zero padding digits in a 64 bit unsigned integer. The encoded value can be reversed into a "normalized" version of the original 10 character string using the `decode_string_id` function.

* The `hash_string_id` function creates a 64 bit unsigned integer hash of the input string.

<a name="binaryfiles"></a>
## Binary files for lookup tables

A direct application of the VariantKey representation is the ability to create lookup tables as simple binary files.  
The binary lookup-table files are natively supported by the variantkey library and can be generated using the scripts in `resources/tools/`.  
NOTE: The `vkhexbin.sh` script requires [bcftools](https://github.com/samtools/bcftools/tree/develop) with variantkey support.
The `vcfnorm.sh` script requires the [vt](https://github.com/atks/vt) tool.

Prebuilt binary files can be downloaded from:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/variantkey/files/

* **`fasta.bin`**
    Binary version of the reference genome sequence FASTA file.  
    It only cntains the first 25 sequences for chromosomes 1 to 22, X, Y and MT.  
    This binary file can be generated by the [fastabin.sh](https://github.com/tecnickcom/variantkey/blob/master/resources/tools/fastabin.sh) script from a genome reference FASTA file.
    
* **`rsvk.bin`**
    Lookup table to retrieve VariantKey from rsID.  
    This binary file can be generated by the [rsvk.sh](https://github.com/tecnickcom/variantkey/blob/master/resources/tools/rsvk.sh) script from a normalized TSV file.
    The VCF file can be normalized using the [vcfnorm.sh](https://github.com/tecnickcom/variantkey/blob/master/resources/tools/vcfnorm.sh) script.  
    This can also be in *Apache Arrow File* format with a single *RecordBatch*, or *Feather* format. The first column must contain the rsID sorted in ascending order.
    
* **`vkrs.bin`**
    Lookup table to retrieve rsID from VariantKey.  
    This binary file can be generated by the [vkrs.sh](https://github.com/tecnickcom/variantkey/blob/master/resources/tools/vkrs.sh) script from a normalized TSV file.
    The VCF file can be normalized using the [vcfnorm.sh](https://github.com/tecnickcom/variantkey/blob/master/resources/tools/vcfnorm.sh) script.
    This can also be in *Apache Arrow File* format with a single *RecordBatch*, or *Feather* format. The first column must contain the VariantKey sorted in ascending order.
    
* **`nrvk.bin`**
    Lookup table to retrieve the original `REF` and `ALT` string for the non-reversible VariantKey.  
    This binary file can be generated by the [nrvk.sh](https://github.com/tecnickcom/variantkey/blob/master/resources/tools/nrvk.sh) script from a TSV file with the following format:

    ```
    [16 BYTE VARIANTKEY HEX]\t[REF STRING]\t[ALT STRING]\n...

    for example:

    b800c35bbcece603	AAAAAAAAGG	AG
    1800c351f61f65d3	A	AAGAAAGAAAG
    ```

## C Library

* [C source code documentation](https://tecnickcom.github.io/variantkey/c/index.html)
* [C Usage Examples](c/test/test_example.c)

The reference implementation of this library is written in header-only C programming language in a way that is also compatible with C++.

This project includes a Makefile that allows you to test and build the project in a Linux-compatible system with simple commands.  
All the artifacts and reports produced using this Makefile are stored in the *target* folder.  

* To see all available options: `make help`
* To build everything: `make all`

### Example command-Line tool

The code inside the `c/vk` folder is used to generate the `vk` command line tool.  
This tools requires the pre-normalized positional arguments `CHROM`, `POS`, `REF`, `ALT` and returns the VariantKey in hexadecimal representation.
